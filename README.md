Our project, Chalk Street aggregates a set of courses available for topics such as computer science, machine learning, natural language processing and related topics and presents a method for our users to retrieve these courses based on metrics that we believe would help our users to  search and find courses that better match with their need and capability and thus support them in making an appropriate course selection.

Description of our Resource:
For our ‘course catalogue’ organising system, a resource is an individual, independent online course. The courses were offered in different languages and were offered by different platforms and institutions ranging from University of California, Berkeley to University of Denmark (DTU).

Our Method:				
Identify categories 
Identifying attributes
Crawling Data 
Data Parsing 
Developing a classification system 
Develop a resource (course) retrieval system by utilizing Index and Search Implementation, cosine similarity
